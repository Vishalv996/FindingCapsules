# FindingCapsules

This is a game-like environment created using Unity 3D for Windows. The concept
of this game is simple. 3 capsules are set up at various places across an obstacle
course and the player is supposed to find all three of them before they lose all the
10 lifelines. Every time they find a capsule they get a 0.5 increment in the lifelines
and every time they collide with an obstacle, they lose a lifeline. If they collide with
an obstacle more than once, a deduction of 0.5 in the player's lifeline takes place.
